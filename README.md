# Simon-Game
Have completed another front-end web games added to my whole repositories! This game is quite basic, and as a gamer you can just press any key to start the game that actually
triggers the game mechanism that beeps one of the four colored boxes on the screen. The beeped box goes into an array which stores 
the sequence of color buttons to be pressed. The gamer then has to copy that particular sequence and once the full sequence has been copied
another colored button gets added to that sequence making the sequence longer as each level progresses. The gamer can make upto as many stages
as they are able to.

I added sounds to the game upon button pressing and gameover sound when the player loses the game. All the sound files are attached to the sounds folder.

Run Instructions: You can either choose to download the files and open index.html with a browser, or you can choose to access the in the repository link to play the game
